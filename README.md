# The-Watson-Test
This repository is for the eyes of those who will review my work. Included is a library that picks out unique emails, a console application that lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe, a few sql queries bundled into one .sql file that demonstrate my sql capabilities, and another .sql file that is my creation of a relational database to track activity at a campsite.

My own words include that there were aspects of sql I had to learn along the way. The included WPF Tic-Tac-Toe was an attempt to make something more. but seeing the time restraint made me fall back to a console app which still took longer than expected to validate user input. I accomplished more than I thought I would in the sql assignments as I am still learning things as I need them. I also wished to build unit tests for Tic-Tac-Toe, but Learning and finishing the questions took precidence.
